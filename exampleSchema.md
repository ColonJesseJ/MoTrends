### EXAMPLE SCHEMA

MoTrends database stores trend insights generated by the user. Each input by the user is inputted into the database. Once the user is finished with their input and generate, they see more data that would also be placed into the database. These include the current/predicted trend, engagement score, and actions. In addition, there more data that is generated that can't be seen after generation and more used for /view. Such as id, creation time, and status.
